## Music Searcher
A very simplistic extension that quickly searches Spotify and provides albums and top tracks for any artist located in their database.

### To Install
1. Clone or download the music_searcher folder of this repository.
2. Open a Chrome browser and go to the extension page (chrome://extensions)
3. Ensure the "Developer Mode" checkbox is checked, then click "Load unpacked extension..."
4. Navigate where the extension was saved and select the music_searcher folder
5. The music icon should now appear next to the Chrome omnibox

### ToDo
- Use CSS animations on modal to enhance user experience
- Replace nested callbacks with promises
- Research/replace messy DOM manipulation with templates/framework
